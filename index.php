            <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>

            <p class="introduction">
        
                My name is Terry Leeshanok, I am 24 years old student from Brampton, Ontario and a future graduate from Algoma University with a bachelors of Computer SCience. 
                Furthermore I have also gradutated from the University of Waterloo, 
                with a Bachelor of Environmental Studies, majoring in Environment and Business and minoring in 
                Geography and Environmental Management.
                Beyond my academics I have a wide variety of work experience in all different fields and positions.
                But besides work I love to play sports, travel and photography.
                As industries are constantly changing, and technology is evolving, I pride myself in having quite the diverse
                set of skills and experiences which I hope can help me find a long term career

                <h2>Past</h2>
    
                <p class="career">
                    Having been in a co-op program during my time at the University of Waterloo, I had the chance to work in many differnt fields and positions.
                    From tech companies, public organizations, non governmental organizations, startups, and small businesses. This has given me the understanding of differnet business
                    environments, workplace expectations, and better chance to see my possible career paths.
                    Graduating from my first undergraduate degree during the pandemic was tough, especially when trying to find a job.
                    After jumping between a few temporary jobs, I was not entierly sure or happy with the trajectory of my career.
                    With not much idea of what to do next, and countless job rejections, I decided to continue my academic pursuit
                    by enrolling at Algoma University in a computer science program. </p>
                <h2>Present</h2>
                <p>Diving head first into Computer Science, I was not quite sure what to expect, but from trying to learn on my own, I realized how hard
                    and confusing it was not knowing where to start, or constantly dipping my toes in differnt aspects of computer science.
                    Finally being enrolled in a program guided me in a direction starting with learning Java and data structures.
                    learning Java as my first program also helped me realize my passion for being creative by seeing how my code can be turned into real programs or just simple outputs in the console.
                    I would never have been able to learn as much as I have in 1 year without this program, and although it has its flaws, I am very happy with the outcome.
                    I have enough background knowledge to pick up any language pretty easily as I self taught myself python for a course, and hope to continue to learn other language and expand my knowledge.
                    Computer science and coding has opened the door and given me direction to what kind of career I want to pursue in the long run.
                </p>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through the Computer science I was able to learn skills and coding languages such as java, python, javascript, css, html, react, php and sql. 
                        Although I have not been able to build much personal projects due to the stresses of school and school related projects.
                        Upon graduation my goal is to continue learning and expanding my coding skills towards personal projects which I am more passionate about.
                        This consists of app development, react, nodeJS and Rubyrails to become a better full stack developer and develop an impressive portfolio.
                        Hopefully I will be able to land a full time developer position in the near future!
                    </p>

                    <h2>This Website</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website was created to help me practive my web development skills aquired in my internet tools class, and hopefully serve as the backbone of a portfolio website in the future. 
                        Although it is not that impressive at the moment, as I continue to learn new techniques and frameworks in webdev, I will continue to update this website as practice and to reference to for coding examples
